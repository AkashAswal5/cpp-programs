/* 
list is a container in the STL,
 that implements a doubly linked list.

  Unlike vector, which provides a dynamic array, 
  
  a list allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements at
   both ends or in the middle of the container.



   Key Features of list:
Doubly Linked List: Each element is linked to both its previous and next elements.
Efficient Insert/Delete: Fast insertion and deletion at any position (O(1) time for most operations).
No Random Access: Elements cannot be accessed directly using indices like in vector.
